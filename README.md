Created On April 2022 Using C

The C code is designed to analyze and process real temperature data 
collected by the NOAA for six Great Lakes during the calendar year 2020. 
The code will read and store the data, perform various calculations, 
and generate specific information:

1.) Calculate the yearly average temperature for each lake and the combined average for all lakes.
2.) Determine the coldest and warmest lakes based on their yearly average temperatures. Identify lakes above and below the overall average.
3.) Find the dates and temperatures of the warmest and coldest water temperatures for each lake.
4.) Identify the date, lake, and temperature of the overall warmest and coldest temperatures among all lakes.
5.) Calculate the summer average temperature for each lake and order lakes from warmest to coldest. Compare this order to the yearly average.
6.) Calculate the winter average temperature for each lake and order lakes from warmest to coldest. Compare this order to the yearly average.
7.) Determine the number of swim-friendly days (above 20 degrees) for each lake.
8.) Calculate the number of frozen days (below 0 degrees) for each lake.
9.) Repeat question 1, calculating the yearly averages for 2019, and compare the results with 2020.

In summary, the C code processes temperature data for the six Great Lakes, performs various calculations, 
and presents insights about yearly averages, extreme temperatures, swimming days, freezing days, and changes
 between 2019 and 2020.
